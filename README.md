# Beat-Machine
> A single page Javascript application for creating and saving drum beats using a variety of drum kits.

Inspired by the Roland TR-808, Beat-Machine is a fun hands on rhythm making tool. Users can create as many beats as they like, save them for later listening/editing, change the beat tempo, drum kit and even add a swing rhythm to the beat.
